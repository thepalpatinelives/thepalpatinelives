- 👋 Hi, my name is @thepalpatinelives
- 👀 I happen to be interested in mycology and allowing people of all ages and localities to freely participate in the advancement of mycology (the scientific study of fungi, including mushrooms).
- 🌱 I currently happen to be learning the fundamentals of Ruby On Rails and the related software used to improve www.MushroomObserver.org.
- 💞️ I feel like it's time to start looking to collaborate on MO and not much else currently. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Email me at Tommy.Davis.Jr (--at--) Tutanota.com
Cheers!
