- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is @thepalpatinelives
- ðŸ‘€ I happen to be interested in mycology and allowing people of all ages and localities to freely participate in the advancement of mycology (the scientific study of fungi, including mushrooms).
- ðŸŒ± I've been learning the fundamentals of Ruby On Rails and the related software used to improve www.MushroomObserver.org.
-  I feel like it's time to start looking into collaboration on MO.
